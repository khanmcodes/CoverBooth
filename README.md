This project is a web-based tool designed for musicians, singers, and creators. It serves as a customizable lyrics display with integrated lighting controls, allowing users to set the perfect atmosphere for recording or practicing. With adjustable background and text colors, you can use the monitor as a key light for late-night shoots while maintaining excellent text visibility. The app also features auto-scrolling lyrics, customizable text options, and clipboard paste support for quick song access.

## How the Idea Came About

A few days ago, I was recording a cover, and my usual process was to open my lyrics and chords in one tab and a white image or a solid color in another tab to use as a light source. It was getting hard to navigate between both tabs while recording, and I thought, "I wish there was a website that could do both things in one." That’s where the idea came in: a customizable lyrics display website that also serves as a lighting tool! With adjustable background colors, the monitor itself becomes a key light, setting the vibe for late-night shoots—cool blues for calm covers, warm oranges for lively tracks, and everything in between.

I designed this tool to be a one-stop solution for artists and creators who need a simple, effective lyrics display during practice or recording. Along with the lighting feature, it includes auto-scrolling lyrics, customizable text options, and clipboard paste support to quickly pull up any song. Whether you’re a musician, content creator, or just someone who enjoys singing along, this tool can help you create a better experience for your practice sessions or recordings.
