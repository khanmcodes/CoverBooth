## How the Idea Came About

A few days ago, I was recording a cover and faced the challenge of switching between different tabs: one for the lyrics and another for lighting. It made the recording process cumbersome, and I thought, "What if there was a tool that could do both?" Thus, CoverBooth was born â€“ a website that allows you to display and customize lyrics while also using your screen as a key light for optimal recording conditions. This tool was designed with musicians and content creators in mind, providing a seamless experience for both practicing and recording. 

CoverBooth also features a song library with 9 demo songs, allowing users to easily select and customize lyrics for practice or recording. You can edit the lyrics to match your performance needs, whether it's adding or removing lines, or adjusting them to your style.

## Features

- **Customizable Background Colors**: Set the perfect background color to match the mood of your song, from cool blues for calm covers to vibrant oranges for energetic performances.

- **Text Visibility**: Adjust the text color to ensure readability, even as you change the background color.

- **Auto-Scrolling Lyrics**: Lyrics will automatically scroll so you can focus on performing without needing to manually navigate the text.

- **Song Library with Demo Songs**: Choose from a demo library of 9 songs, each ready for customization to suit your style. You can modify the lyrics to keep only the parts you want to cover, or add your own adjustments to match your performance.

- **Responsiveness**: CoverBooth is fully responsive. I implemented a mobile-friendly design by adjusting the layout for smaller screens. On mobile devices, the toolbar was optimized to ensure the interface remains accessible. For instance, the 'Tools' button opens a side modal for mobile users, while the footer keeps essential buttons visible during scrolling, ensuring a smooth experience on all screen sizes.
